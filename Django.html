        Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.
        It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and encourages clean, reusable, and scalable code. Django 
        comes with many built-in features like an admin panel, user authentication, URL routing, and database ORM 
        (Object-Relational Mapping), which save developers a lot of time. It's designed to help developers build web 
        applications quickly while following best practices like the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
        Django is widely used in real-world projects, including content management systems, social networks, and data-driven apps.

        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used 
        to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform 
        tasks such as creating databases, inserting data, updating records, 
        retrieving information, and deleting data. SQL uses simple, English-like 
        syntax with commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE.
         It is widely used in almost every application that requires data storage,
          from small websites to large enterprise systems. SQL is supported by 
          many database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL
           Server, making it a fundamental skill for anyone working with databases.

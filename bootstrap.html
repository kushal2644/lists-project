        Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used for designing 
        responsive and mobile-first websites. Developed by Twitter, it provides a 
        collection of ready-to-use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components such as 
        buttons, navigation bars, modals, forms, and carousels. Bootstrap makes 
        it easy to create clean and consistent layouts without writing a lot of
         custom CSS. One of its key features is the grid system, which helps in
          building flexible and responsive web designs that work well on different
           screen sizes. Because of its simplicity and wide browser support, 
           Bootstrap is widely used by both beginners and professional web
            developers.

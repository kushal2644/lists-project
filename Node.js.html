        Node.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers
        to run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server side. Built on Google
        Chromeâ€™s V8 engine, Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes 
        it ideal for building fast and scalable network applications like APIs, chat apps, and real-time 
        services. It uses JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, making it easier to build
        full-stack applications. With the help of npm (Node Package Manager), developers can access a huge
        ecosystem of packages to speed up development.

    <p>Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that 
        allows developers to run JavaScript on the backend.
        Built on Google Chrome's V8 engine, Node.js is known for its non-blocking,
        event-driven architecture, which makes it lightweight and efficient, especially 
        for real-time applications like chat apps, APIs, and streaming services. It uses 
        a single-threaded model, but can handle many connections simultaneously through
        asynchronous I/O. With npm (Node Package Manager), developers have access to 
        thousands of reusable packages, speeding up development. 
        Node.js is widely used in modern web development, often for building scalable, high-performance applications.

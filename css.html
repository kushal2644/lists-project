        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control 
        the appearance and layout of HTML elements on a web page. It allows
         developers to apply styles like colors, fonts, spacing, borders,
          and positioning to make websites visually appealing and user-friendly.
           CSS separates content (HTML) from design, making it easier to manage
            and update the look of a site. It supports responsive design through 
            media queries, enabling websites to adapt to different screen sizes 
            and devices. CSS is an essential technology in web development, used 
            alongside HTML and JavaScript to build modern and interactive websites.

        MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible,
         JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional 
         relational databases that use tables and rows, MongoDB uses collections
          and documents, making it ideal for handling unstructured or 
          semi-structured data. It allows for dynamic schemas, meaning you
           can store different fields in different documents within the same 
           collection. MongoDB is highly scalable, supports high performance,
            and is often used in modern web applications, big data projects,
             and real-time analytics. Its flexibility and ease of use make it 
             a strong choice for developers working with large and evolving
              datasets.
